# SimpleSimulator
This program is powered by Qt.

Explicitly speaking, the program is a game including many aspects.
For example, players can build buildings, manage buildings, and their companys. Later, I will add more features such as change the size of buildings, see the detail of buildings, and control the economy of game.
It's the first time I build such a large project, so it must be plenty of bugs in this game. I'm looking forward to your commits.
